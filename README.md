# Whisperas : The Pancreas Whisperer
A mobile portable web app designed to help diabetics track their daily well-being and discover trends over time.

## Introduction
This app is special to me, because as a Type 1 diabetic myself I've been wanting to produce a tool that can meaningfully benefit other patients in my community. 
Like any chronic illness, managing Type 1 Diabetes is highly involved and often exhausting. Whisperas aims to simplify patients' lives by helping them visualize the relationships between their treatment regimen, physical activity, diet, and anything else they'd like to record.

Whisperas is built from the ground-up to ensure user privacy and security. The tool does NOT require, request, nor record any personally-identifying information, all communications between the client and server are over secure a secure TLS connection, passwords are never stored in plain-text, and the database itself is encrypted.
